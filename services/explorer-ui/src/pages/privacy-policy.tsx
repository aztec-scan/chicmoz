            notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by
            law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No
            purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal
            information for longer than 6 months past the termination of the
            user's account. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to
            process your personal information, we will either delete or
            anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for
            example, because your personal information has been stored in backup
            archives), then we will securely store your personal information and
            isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.{" "}

          <h3>8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>
          <p>
            In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a
            system of organisational and technical security measures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Information security is of utmost importance to us. We have
            implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational
            security measures designed to protect the security of any personal
            information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts
            to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
            Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be
            100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,
            cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able
            to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or
            modify your information. Although we will do our absolute best to
            protect your personal information, transmission of personal
            information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should
            only access the Services within a secure environment.

          <h3>9. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h3>
          <p>
            In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to
            children under 18 years of age.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18
            years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at
            least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and
            consent to such minor dependent's use of the Services. If we learn
            that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has
            been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable
            measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you
            become aware of any data we may have collected from children under
            age 18, please contact us at{" "}

          <p>
            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
            applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you
            can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
            about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At
            this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
            implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not
            currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
            automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If
            a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
            future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version
            of this privacy notice.

            Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
            determine you are the same person about whom we have the information
            in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to
            provide information so that we can match it with information you
            have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of
            request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so
            that we can match the information you provide with the information
            we already have on file, or we may contact you through a
            communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously
            provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the
            circumstances dictate.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will only use personal information provided in your request to
            verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent
            possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you
            for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your
            identity from the information already maintained by us, we may
            request that you provide additional information for the purposes of
            verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention
            purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as
            soon as we finish verifying you.
