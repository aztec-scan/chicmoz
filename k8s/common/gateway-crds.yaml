                  description: |-
                    Ancestors is a list of ancestor resources (usually Gateways) that are
                    associated with the policy, and the status of the policy with respect to
                    each ancestor. When this policy attaches to a parent, the controller that
                    manages the parent and the ancestors MUST add an entry to this list when
                    the controller first sees the policy and SHOULD update the entry as
                    appropriate when the relevant ancestor is modified.


                    Note that choosing the relevant ancestor is left to the Policy designers;
                    an important part of Policy design is designing the right object level at
                    which to namespace this status.


                    Note also that implementations MUST ONLY populate ancestor status for
                    the Ancestor resources they are responsible for. Implementations MUST
                    use the ControllerName field to uniquely identify the entries in this list
                    that they are responsible for.


                    Note that to achieve this, the list of PolicyAncestorStatus structs
                    MUST be treated as a map with a composite key, made up of the AncestorRef
                    and ControllerName fields combined.


                    A maximum of 16 ancestors will be represented in this list. An empty list
                    means the Policy is not relevant for any ancestors.


                    If this slice is full, implementations MUST NOT add further entries.
                    Instead they MUST consider the policy unimplementable and signal that
                    on any related resources such as the ancestor that would be referenced
                    here. For example, if this list was full on BackendTLSPolicy, no
                    additional Gateways would be able to reference the Service targeted by
                    the BackendTLSPolicy.

                    description: |-
                      PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an
                      associated Ancestor.


                      Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it
                      in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the
                      Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and
                      the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most
                      useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations
                      SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers
                      have a _very_ good reason otherwise.


                      In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which
                      resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy
                      targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.


                      Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the
                      ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same
                      Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying
                      implementations.


                      For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is
                      used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.
                      In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
                      ancestor object referred to in this status.


                      Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the
                      relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.


                      This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,

                              Namespace is the namespace of the referent. When unspecified, this refers
                              to the local namespace of the Route.


                              Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                              boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                              allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                              Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                              generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.



                              ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                              routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                              any namespace to the Service.


                              ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                              "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                              connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                              the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                              ParentRef of the Route.

                              Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                              differently based on the type of parent resource.


                              When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                              listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                              select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                              networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                              as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                              and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                              must match both specified values.



                              When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the
                              Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,
                              the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.



                              Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                              Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                              document how/if Port is interpreted.


                              For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                              long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                              listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                              namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                              from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                              the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                              SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource. In the
                              following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:


                              * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                              are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                              both specified values.
                              * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                              are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                              both specified values.


                              Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                              If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                              interpreted.


                              When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                              For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                              least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                              listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                              namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from
                              the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
                              Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                        Defaults:
                        1. HTTPS Routes: h2 and http/1.1 are enabled in listener context.
                        2. Other Routes: ALPN is disabled.
                        3. Backends: proxy uses the appropriate ALPN options for the backend protocol.
                        When an empty list is provided, the ALPN TLS extension is disabled.

                        Defaults to [h2, http/1.1] if not specified.

                        Typical Supported values are:
                        - http/1.0
                        - http/1.1

                  description: |-
                    Ancestors is a list of ancestor resources (usually Gateways) that are
                    associated with the policy, and the status of the policy with respect to
                    each ancestor. When this policy attaches to a parent, the controller that
                    manages the parent and the ancestors MUST add an entry to this list when
                    the controller first sees the policy and SHOULD update the entry as
                    appropriate when the relevant ancestor is modified.

                    Note that choosing the relevant ancestor is left to the Policy designers;
                    an important part of Policy design is designing the right object level at
                    which to namespace this status.

                    Note also that implementations MUST ONLY populate ancestor status for
                    the Ancestor resources they are responsible for. Implementations MUST
                    use the ControllerName field to uniquely identify the entries in this list
                    that they are responsible for.

                    Note that to achieve this, the list of PolicyAncestorStatus structs
                    MUST be treated as a map with a composite key, made up of the AncestorRef
                    and ControllerName fields combined.

                    A maximum of 16 ancestors will be represented in this list. An empty list
                    means the Policy is not relevant for any ancestors.

                    If this slice is full, implementations MUST NOT add further entries.
                    Instead they MUST consider the policy unimplementable and signal that
                    on any related resources such as the ancestor that would be referenced
                    here. For example, if this list was full on BackendTLSPolicy, no
                    additional Gateways would be able to reference the Service targeted by
                    the BackendTLSPolicy.

                      PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an
                      associated Ancestor.

                      Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it
                      in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the
                      Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and
                      the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most
                      useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations
                      SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers
                      have a _very_ good reason otherwise.

                      In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which
                      resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy
                      targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.

                      Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the
                      ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same
                      Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying
                      implementations.

                      For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is
                      used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.
                      In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
                      ancestor object referred to in this status.

                      Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the
                      relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.

                      This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,
                      with a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.

                              allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                              Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                              generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                              ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"

                              ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                              "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                              connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                              the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a

                          Notes for implementors:

                          Conditions are a listType `map`, which means that they function like a
                          map with a key of the `type` field _in the k8s apiserver_.

                          This means that implementations must obey some rules when updating this
                          section.

                          * Implementations MUST perform a read-modify-write cycle on this field
                            before modifying it. That is, when modifying this field, implementations
                            must be confident they have fetched the most recent version of this field,
                            and ensure that changes they make are on that recent version.
                          * Implementations MUST NOT remove or reorder Conditions that they are not
                            directly responsible for. For example, if an implementation sees a Condition
                            with type `special.io/SomeField`, it MUST NOT remove, change or update that

                          * Implementations MUST always _merge_ changes into Conditions of the same Type,
                            rather than creating more than one Condition of the same Type.
                          * Implementations MUST always update the `observedGeneration` field of the
                            Condition to the `metadata.generation` of the Gateway at the time of update creation.
                          * If the `observedGeneration` of a Condition is _greater than_ the value the
                            implementation knows about, then it MUST NOT perform the update on that Condition,
                            but must wait for a future reconciliation and status update. (The assumption is that
                            the implementation's copy of the object is stale and an update will be re-triggered
                            if relevant.)

            GatewayClass describes a class of Gateways available to the user for creating
            Gateway resources.


            It is recommended that this resource be used as a template for Gateways. This
            means that a Gateway is based on the state of the GatewayClass at the time it
            was created and changes to the GatewayClass or associated parameters are not
            propagated down to existing Gateways. This recommendation is intended to
            limit the blast radius of changes to GatewayClass or associated parameters.
            If implementations choose to propagate GatewayClass changes to existing
            Gateways, that MUST be clearly documented by the implementation.


            Whenever one or more Gateways are using a GatewayClass, implementations SHOULD
            add the `gateway-exists-finalizer.gateway.networking.k8s.io` finalizer on the
            associated GatewayClass. This ensures that a GatewayClass associated with a
            Gateway is not deleted while in use.


            GatewayClass is a Cluster level resource.

                    ParametersRef can reference a standard Kubernetes resource, i.e. ConfigMap,

            GatewayClass describes a class of Gateways available to the user for creating
            Gateway resources.


            It is recommended that this resource be used as a template for Gateways. This
            means that a Gateway is based on the state of the GatewayClass at the time it
            was created and changes to the GatewayClass or associated parameters are not
            propagated down to existing Gateways. This recommendation is intended to
            limit the blast radius of changes to GatewayClass or associated parameters.
            If implementations choose to propagate GatewayClass changes to existing
            Gateways, that MUST be clearly documented by the implementation.


            Whenever one or more Gateways are using a GatewayClass, implementations SHOULD
            add the `gateway-exists-finalizer.gateway.networking.k8s.io` finalizer on the
            associated GatewayClass. This ensures that a GatewayClass associated with a
            Gateway is not deleted while in use.


            GatewayClass is a Cluster level resource.

                    controller does not require any additional configuration.


                    ParametersRef can reference a standard Kubernetes resource, i.e. ConfigMap,
                    or an implementation-specific custom resource. The resource can be

                    The Addresses field represents a request for the address(es) on the

                    This could be the IP address or hostname of an external load balancer or
                    other networking infrastructure, or some other address that traffic will
                    be sent to.


                    If no Addresses are specified, the implementation MAY schedule the
                    Gateway in an implementation-specific manner, assigning an appropriate
                    set of Addresses.


                    The implementation MUST bind all Listeners to every GatewayAddress that
                    it assigns to the Gateway and add a corresponding entry in

                    Each Listener in a set of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway)

                    "Listeners in a single Gateway" because implementations MAY merge configuration
                    from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_
                    apply in that case).


                    Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique
                    combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.


                    Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered

                    The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct
                    Listener. When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for
                    example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation
                    can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other
                    Listener fields.


                    For example, the following Listener scenarios are distinct:


                    1. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that all use the "HTTP"
                       Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.
                    2. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that use either the "HTTPS" or
                       "TLS" Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.
                    3. A mixture of "TCP" and "UDP" Protocol Listeners, where no Listener
                       with the same Protocol has the same Port value.


                    Some fields in the Listener struct have possible values that affect
                    whether the Listener is distinct. Hostname is particularly relevant
                    for HTTP or HTTPS protocols.


                    When using the Hostname value to select between same-Port, same-Protocol
                    Listeners, the Hostname value must be different on each Listener for the
                    Listener to be distinct.


                    When the Listeners are distinct based on Hostname, inbound request
                    hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname
                    values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.


                    Exact matches must be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard
                    matches must be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)
                    matches. For example, `"foo.example.com"` takes precedence over
                    `"*.example.com"`, and `"*.example.com"` takes precedence over `""`.


                    Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific
                    wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.
                    For example, `"*.foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`.
                    The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the
                    hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.


                    The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to
                    the left, however, so `"*.example.com"` will match both
                    `"foo.bar.example.com"` _and_ `"bar.example.com"`.


                    If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those
                    Listeners are Conflicted, and the implementation MUST set the "Conflicted"
                    condition in the Listener Status to "True".


                    Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted
                    Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains
                    no Conflicted Listeners. To put this another way, implementations may
                    accept a partial Listener set only if they throw out *all* the conflicting
                    Listeners. No picking one of the conflicting listeners as the winner.
                    This also means that the Gateway must have at least one non-conflicting
                    Listener in this case, otherwise it violates the requirement that at
                    least one Listener must be present.


                    The implementation MUST set a "ListenersNotValid" condition on the
                    Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or
                    not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly
                    indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are
                    Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD
                    indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.


                    A Gateway's Listeners are considered "compatible" if:


                    1. They are distinct.
                    2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses
                       requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned
                       addresses.


                    Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across
                    implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation
                    may not be compatible for another.


                    For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners
                    on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port
                    would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.


                    Note that requests SHOULD match at most one Listener. For example, if
                    Listeners are defined for "foo.example.com" and "*.example.com", a
                    request to "foo.example.com" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached
                    to the "foo.example.com" Listener (and not the "*.example.com" Listener).
                    This concept is known as "Listener Isolation". Implementations that do
                    not support Listener Isolation MUST clearly document this.


                    Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of
                    Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.

                          Although a client request may match multiple route rules, only one rule
                          may ultimately receive the request. Matching precedence MUST be
                          determined in order of the following criteria:


                          * The most specific match as defined by the Route type.
                          * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. For example, a Route with
                            a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:03" is given precedence over
                            a Route with a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:04".
                          * If everything else is equivalent, the Route appearing first in
                            alphabetical order (namespace/name) should be given precedence. For
                            example, foo/bar is given precedence over foo/baz.


                          All valid rules within a Route attached to this Listener should be
                          implemented. Invalid Route rules can be ignored (sometimes that will mean
                          the full Route). If a Route rule transitions from valid to invalid,
                          support for that Route rule should be dropped to ensure consistency. For
                          example, even if a filter specified by a Route rule is invalid, the rest
                          of the rules within that Route should still be supported.

                        description: |-
                          Hostname specifies the virtual hostname to match for protocol types that
                          define this concept. When unspecified, all hostnames are matched. This
                          field is ignored for protocols that don't require hostname based
                          matching.


                          Implementations MUST apply Hostname matching appropriately for each of
                          the following protocols:


                          * TLS: The Listener Hostname MUST match the SNI.
                          * HTTP: The Listener Hostname MUST match the Host header of the request.
                          * HTTPS: The Listener Hostname SHOULD match at both the TLS and HTTP
                            protocol layers as described above. If an implementation does not
                            ensure that both the SNI and Host header match the Listener hostname,
                            it MUST clearly document that.


                          For HTTPRoute and TLSRoute resources, there is an interaction with the
                          `spec.hostnames` array. When both listener and route specify hostnames,
                          there MUST be an intersection between the values for a Route to be
                          accepted. For more information, refer to the Route specific Hostnames
                          documentation.


                          Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted
                          as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
                          both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.

                                Gateway is terminated at the Gateway. This mode requires certificates
                                to be specified in some way, such as populating the certificateRefs
                                field.
                              - Passthrough: The TLS session is NOT terminated by the Gateway. This
                                implies that the Gateway can't decipher the TLS stream except for
                                the ClientHello message of the TLS protocol. The certificateRefs field
                                is ignored in this mode.

                          successfully attached to this Listener.


                          Successful attachment of a Route to a Listener is based solely on the
                          combination of the AllowedRoutes field on the corresponding Listener
                          and the Route's ParentRefs field. A Route is successfully attached to
                          a Listener when it is selected by the Listener's AllowedRoutes field
                          AND the Route has a valid ParentRef selecting the whole Gateway
                          resource or a specific Listener as a parent resource (more detail on
                          attachment semantics can be found in the documentation on the various
                          Route kinds ParentRefs fields). Listener or Route status does not impact
                          successful attachment, i.e. the AttachedRoutes field count MUST be set
                          for Listeners with condition Accepted: false and MUST count successfully
                          attached Routes that may themselves have Accepted: false conditions.


                          Uses for this field include troubleshooting Route attachment and
                          measuring blast radius/impact of changes to a Listener.

                    Gateway in an implementation-specific manner, assigning an appropriate
                    set of Addresses.


                    The implementation MUST bind all Listeners to every GatewayAddress that
                    it assigns to the Gateway and add a corresponding entry in
                    GatewayStatus.Addresses.

                    Listeners associated with this Gateway. Listeners define
                    logical endpoints that are bound on this Gateway's addresses.
                    At least one Listener MUST be specified.


                    Each Listener in a set of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway)
                    MUST be _distinct_, in that a traffic flow MUST be able to be assigned to
                    exactly one listener. (This section uses "set of Listeners" rather than
                    "Listeners in a single Gateway" because implementations MAY merge configuration
                    from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_
                    apply in that case).


                    Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique
                    combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.


                    Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered
                    Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on their
                    targeted conformance profile:


                    HTTP Profile


                    1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP
                    2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided


                    TLS Profile


                    1. TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough


                    "Distinct" Listeners have the following property:


                    The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct
                    Listener. When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for
                    example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation
                    can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other
                    Listener fields.


                    For example, the following Listener scenarios are distinct:


                    1. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that all use the "HTTP"
                       Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.
                    2. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that use either the "HTTPS" or
                       "TLS" Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.
                    3. A mixture of "TCP" and "UDP" Protocol Listeners, where no Listener
                       with the same Protocol has the same Port value.


                    Some fields in the Listener struct have possible values that affect
                    whether the Listener is distinct. Hostname is particularly relevant
                    for HTTP or HTTPS protocols.


                    When using the Hostname value to select between same-Port, same-Protocol
                    Listeners, the Hostname value must be different on each Listener for the
                    Listener to be distinct.


                    When the Listeners are distinct based on Hostname, inbound request
                    hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname
                    values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.


                    Exact matches must be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard
                    matches must be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)
                    matches. For example, `"foo.example.com"` takes precedence over
                    `"*.example.com"`, and `"*.example.com"` takes precedence over `""`.


                    Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific
                    wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.
                    For example, `"*.foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`.
                    The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the
                    hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.


                    The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to
                    the left, however, so `"*.example.com"` will match both
                    `"foo.bar.example.com"` _and_ `"bar.example.com"`.


                    If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those
                    Listeners are Conflicted, and the implementation MUST set the "Conflicted"
                    condition in the Listener Status to "True".


                    Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted
                    Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains
                    no Conflicted Listeners. To put this another way, implementations may
                    accept a partial Listener set only if they throw out *all* the conflicting
                    Listeners. No picking one of the conflicting listeners as the winner.
                    This also means that the Gateway must have at least one non-conflicting
                    Listener in this case, otherwise it violates the requirement that at
                    least one Listener must be present.


                    The implementation MUST set a "ListenersNotValid" condition on the
                    Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or
                    not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly
                    indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are
                    Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD
                    indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.


                    A Gateway's Listeners are considered "compatible" if:


                    1. They are distinct.
                    2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses
                       requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned
                       addresses.


                    Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across
                    implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation
                    may not be compatible for another.


                    For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners
                    on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port
                    would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.


                    Note that requests SHOULD match at most one Listener. For example, if
                    Listeners are defined for "foo.example.com" and "*.example.com", a
                    request to "foo.example.com" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached
                    to the "foo.example.com" Listener (and not the "*.example.com" Listener).
                    This concept is known as "Listener Isolation". Implementations that do
                    not support Listener Isolation MUST clearly document this.


                    Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of
                    Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.

                          Although a client request may match multiple route rules, only one rule
                          may ultimately receive the request. Matching precedence MUST be
                          determined in order of the following criteria:


                          * The most specific match as defined by the Route type.
                          * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. For example, a Route with
                            a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:03" is given precedence over
                            a Route with a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:04".
                          * If everything else is equivalent, the Route appearing first in
                            alphabetical order (namespace/name) should be given precedence. For
                            example, foo/bar is given precedence over foo/baz.


                          All valid rules within a Route attached to this Listener should be
                          implemented. Invalid Route rules can be ignored (sometimes that will mean
                          the full Route). If a Route rule transitions from valid to invalid,
                          support for that Route rule should be dropped to ensure consistency. For
                          example, even if a filter specified by a Route rule is invalid, the rest
                          of the rules within that Route should still be supported.

                          matching.


                          Implementations MUST apply Hostname matching appropriately for each of
                          the following protocols:


                          * TLS: The Listener Hostname MUST match the SNI.
                          * HTTP: The Listener Hostname MUST match the Host header of the request.
                          * HTTPS: The Listener Hostname SHOULD match at both the TLS and HTTP
                            protocol layers as described above. If an implementation does not
                            ensure that both the SNI and Host header match the Listener hostname,
                            it MUST clearly document that.


                          For HTTPRoute and TLSRoute resources, there is an interaction with the
                          `spec.hostnames` array. When both listener and route specify hostnames,
                          there MUST be an intersection between the values for a Route to be
                          accepted. For more information, refer to the Route specific Hostnames
                          documentation.


                          Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted
                          as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
                          both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.

                              a Listener, but this behavior is implementation-specific.


                              References to a resource in different namespace are invalid UNLESS there
                              is a ReferenceGrant in the target namespace that allows the certificate
                              to be attached. If a ReferenceGrant does not allow this reference, the
                              "ResolvedRefs" condition MUST be set to False for this listener with the
                              "RefNotPermitted" reason.


                              This field is required to have at least one element when the mode is set
                              to "Terminate" (default) and is optional otherwise.


                              CertificateRefs can reference to standard Kubernetes resources, i.e.
                              Secret, or implementation-specific custom resources.

                          Successful attachment of a Route to a Listener is based solely on the
                          combination of the AllowedRoutes field on the corresponding Listener
                          and the Route's ParentRefs field. A Route is successfully attached to
                          a Listener when it is selected by the Listener's AllowedRoutes field
                          AND the Route has a valid ParentRef selecting the whole Gateway
                          resource or a specific Listener as a parent resource (more detail on
                          attachment semantics can be found in the documentation on the various
                          Route kinds ParentRefs fields). Listener or Route status does not impact
                          successful attachment, i.e. the AttachedRoutes field count MUST be set
                          for Listeners with condition Accepted: false and MUST count successfully
                          attached Routes that may themselves have Accepted: false conditions.


                          Uses for this field include troubleshooting Route attachment and
                          measuring blast radius/impact of changes to a Listener.

            GRPCRoute provides a way to route gRPC requests. This includes the capability
            to match requests by hostname, gRPC service, gRPC method, or HTTP/2 header.
            Filters can be used to specify additional processing steps. Backends specify
            where matching requests will be routed.


            GRPCRoute falls under extended support within the Gateway API. Within the
            following specification, the word "MUST" indicates that an implementation
            supporting GRPCRoute must conform to the indicated requirement, but an
            implementation not supporting this route type need not follow the requirement
            unless explicitly indicated.


            Implementations supporting `GRPCRoute` with the `HTTPS` `ProtocolType` MUST
            accept HTTP/2 connections without an initial upgrade from HTTP/1.1, i.e. via
            ALPN. If the implementation does not support this, then it MUST set the
            "Accepted" condition to "False" for the affected listener with a reason of
            "UnsupportedProtocol".  Implementations MAY also accept HTTP/2 connections
            with an upgrade from HTTP/1.


            Implementations supporting `GRPCRoute` with the `HTTP` `ProtocolType` MUST
            support HTTP/2 over cleartext TCP (h2c,
            https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-3.1) without an initial
            upgrade from HTTP/1.1, i.e. with prior knowledge
            (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-3.4). If the implementation
            does not support this, then it MUST set the "Accepted" condition to "False"
            for the affected listener with a reason of "UnsupportedProtocol".
            Implementations MAY also accept HTTP/2 connections with an upgrade from
            HTTP/1, i.e. without prior knowledge.

                    Hostnames defines a set of hostnames to match against the GRPC
                    Host header to select a GRPCRoute to process the request. This matches
                    the RFC 1123 definition of a hostname with 2 notable exceptions:


                    1. IPs are not allowed.
                    2. A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard
                       label MUST appear by itself as the first label.


                    If a hostname is specified by both the Listener and GRPCRoute, there
                    MUST be at least one intersecting hostname for the GRPCRoute to be
                    attached to the Listener. For example:


                    * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches GRPCRoutes
                      that have either not specified any hostnames, or have specified at
                      least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.
                    * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches GRPCRoutes
                      that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at least
                      one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For example,
                      `test.example.com` and `*.example.com` would both match. On the other
                      hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would not match.


                    Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted
                    as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
                    both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.


                    If both the Listener and GRPCRoute have specified hostnames, any
                    GRPCRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be
                    ignored. For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the
                    GRPCRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`,
                    `test.example.net` MUST NOT be considered for a match.


                    If both the Listener and GRPCRoute have specified hostnames, and none
                    match with the criteria above, then the GRPCRoute MUST NOT be accepted by
                    the implementation. The implementation MUST raise an 'Accepted' Condition
                    with a status of `False` in the corresponding RouteParentStatus.


                    If a Route (A) of type HTTPRoute or GRPCRoute is attached to a
                    Listener and that listener already has another Route (B) of the other
                    type attached and the intersection of the hostnames of A and B is
                    non-empty, then the implementation MUST accept exactly one of these two
                    routes, determined by the following criteria, in order:


                    * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.
                    * The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by
                      "{namespace}/{name}".


                    The rejected Route MUST raise an 'Accepted' condition with a status of
                    'False' in the corresponding RouteParentStatus.

                    allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
                    the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
                    namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
                    namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
                    and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
                    not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
                    create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
                    Route.


                    There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:


                    * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                    * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)


                    This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                    resources.


                    ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:


                    * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
                      entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
                      multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
                      be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
                    * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
                      each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
                      optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
                      combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.


                    Some examples:


                    * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
                      same object must also set `sectionName`.
                    * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
                      object must also set `port`.
                    * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
                      referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.


                    It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
                    be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
                    choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
                    case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
                    merged.


                    Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
                    rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                    allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
                    Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                    generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.



                    ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                    routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                    any namespace to the Service.


                    ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                    "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                    connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                    the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                    ParentRef of the Route.

                          differently based on the type of parent resource.


                          When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                          listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                          select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                          networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                          as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                          and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                          must match both specified values.



                          When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the
                          Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,
                          the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.



                          Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                          Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                          document how/if Port is interpreted.


                          For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                          long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                          listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                          namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                          from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                          attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                          the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                          * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                          are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match

                          both specified values.


                          Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                          If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                          interpreted.


                          When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                          For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at

                          listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,

                      GRPCRouteRule defines the semantics for matching a gRPC request based on
                      conditions (matches), processing it (filters), and forwarding the request to
                      an API object (backendRefs).

                          sent.


                          Failure behavior here depends on how many BackendRefs are specified and
                          how many are invalid.


                          If *all* entries in BackendRefs are invalid, and there are also no filters
                          specified in this route rule, *all* traffic which matches this rule MUST
                          receive an `UNAVAILABLE` status.


                          See the GRPCBackendRef definition for the rules about what makes a single
                          GRPCBackendRef invalid.


                          When a GRPCBackendRef is invalid, `UNAVAILABLE` statuses MUST be returned for
                          requests that would have otherwise been routed to an invalid backend. If
                          multiple backends are specified, and some are invalid, the proportion of
                          requests that would otherwise have been routed to an invalid backend
                          MUST receive an `UNAVAILABLE` status.


                          For example, if two backends are specified with equal weights, and one is
                          invalid, 50 percent of traffic MUST receive an `UNAVAILABLE` status.
                          Implementations may choose how that 50 percent is determined.

                            GRPCBackendRef defines how a GRPCRoute forwards a gRPC request.


                            Note that when a namespace different than the local namespace is specified, a
                            ReferenceGrant object is required in the referent namespace to allow that
                            namespace's owner to accept the reference. See the ReferenceGrant
                            documentation for details.


                            <gateway:experimental:description>


                            When the BackendRef points to a Kubernetes Service, implementations SHOULD
                            honor the appProtocol field if it is set for the target Service Port.


                            Implementations supporting appProtocol SHOULD recognize the Kubernetes
                            Standard Application Protocols defined in KEP-3726.


                            If a Service appProtocol isn't specified, an implementation MAY infer the
                            backend protocol through its own means. Implementations MAY infer the
                            protocol from the Route type referring to the backend Service.


                            If a Route is not able to send traffic to the backend using the specified
                            protocol then the backend is considered invalid. Implementations MUST set the
                            "ResolvedRefs" condition to "False" with the "UnsupportedProtocol" reason.

                                      not all implementations will be able to support mirroring to multiple

                                      Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                                      types are classified into three conformance levels:


                                      - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                        "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                        implementations supporting GRPCRoute MUST support core filters.


                                      - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                        "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                        are encouraged to support extended filters.


                                      - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by specific vendors.
                                        In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                        implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                        conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                        is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` MUST be set to
                                        "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.


                                      Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                      extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.


                                      If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                      MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                      that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

                          Filters define the filters that are applied to requests that match
                          this rule.


                          The effects of ordering of multiple behaviors are currently unspecified.
                          This can change in the future based on feedback during the alpha stage.


                          Conformance-levels at this level are defined based on the type of filter:


                          - ALL core filters MUST be supported by all implementations that support
                            GRPCRoute.
                          - Implementers are encouraged to support extended filters.
                          - Implementation-specific custom filters have no API guarantees across
                            implementations.


                          Specifying the same filter multiple times is not supported unless explicitly
                          indicated in the filter.


                          If an implementation can not support a combination of filters, it must clearly
                          document that limitation. In cases where incompatible or unsupported
                          filters are specified and cause the `Accepted` condition to be set to status
                          `False`, implementations may use the `IncompatibleFilters` reason to specify
                          this configuration error.

                                Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                                types are classified into three conformance levels:


                                - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                  "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                  implementations supporting GRPCRoute MUST support core filters.


                                - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                  "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                  are encouraged to support extended filters.


                                - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by specific vendors.
                                  In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                  implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                  conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                  is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` MUST be set to
                                  "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.


                                Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.


                                If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

                          Matches define conditions used for matching the rule against incoming
                          gRPC requests. Each match is independent, i.e. this rule will be matched
                          if **any** one of the matches is satisfied.


                          For example, take the following matches configuration:


                          ```
                          matches:
                          - method:
                              service: foo.bar
                            headers:
                              values:
                                version: 2
                          - method:
                              service: foo.bar.v2
                          ```


                          For a request to match against this rule, it MUST satisfy
                          EITHER of the two conditions:


                          - service of foo.bar AND contains the header `version: 2`
                          - service of foo.bar.v2


                          See the documentation for GRPCRouteMatch on how to specify multiple
                          match conditions to be ANDed together.


                          If no matches are specified, the implementation MUST match every gRPC request.


                          Proxy or Load Balancer routing configuration generated from GRPCRoutes
                          MUST prioritize rules based on the following criteria, continuing on
                          ties. Merging MUST not be done between GRPCRoutes and HTTPRoutes.
                          Precedence MUST be given to the rule with the largest number of:


                          * Characters in a matching non-wildcard hostname.
                          * Characters in a matching hostname.
                          * Characters in a matching service.
                          * Characters in a matching method.
                          * Header matches.


                          If ties still exist across multiple Routes, matching precedence MUST be
                          determined in order of the following criteria, continuing on ties:


                          * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.
                          * The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by
                            "{namespace}/{name}".


                          If ties still exist within the Route that has been given precedence,
                          matching precedence MUST be granted to the first matching rule meeting
                          the above criteria.

                            GRPCRouteMatch defines the predicate used to match requests to a given
                            action. Multiple match types are ANDed together, i.e. the match will
                            evaluate to true only if all conditions are satisfied.


                            For example, the match below will match a gRPC request only if its service
                            is `foo` AND it contains the `version: v1` header:

                    Parents is a list of parent resources (usually Gateways) that are
                    associated with the route, and the status of the route with respect to
                    each parent. When this route attaches to a parent, the controller that
                    manages the parent must add an entry to this list when the controller
                    first sees the route and should update the entry as appropriate when the
                    route or gateway is modified.


                    Note that parent references that cannot be resolved by an implementation
                    of this API will not be added to this list. Implementations of this API
                    can only populate Route status for the Gateways/parent resources they are
                    responsible for.


                    A maximum of 32 Gateways will be represented in this list. An empty list
                    means the route has not been attached to any Gateway.

                          status conditions and listener status.


                          If the Route's ParentRef specifies an existing Gateway that supports
                          Routes of this kind AND that Gateway's controller has sufficient access,
                          then that Gateway's controller MUST set the "Accepted" condition on the
                          Route, to indicate whether the route has been accepted or rejected by the
                          Gateway, and why.


                          A Route MUST be considered "Accepted" if at least one of the Route's
                          rules is implemented by the Gateway.


                          There are a number of cases where the "Accepted" condition may not be set
                          due to lack of controller visibility, that includes when:


                          * The Route refers to a non-existent parent.
                          * The Route is of a type that the controller does not support.
                          * The Route is in a namespace the controller does not have access to.

                              * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)


                              Support for other resources is Implementation-Specific.

                            description: |-
                              Namespace is the namespace of the referent. When unspecified, this refers
                              to the local namespace of the Route.


                              Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                              boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                              allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                              Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                              generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.



                              ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                              routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                              any namespace to the Service.


                              ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                              "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                              connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                              the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                              ParentRef of the Route.

                              Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                              differently based on the type of parent resource.


                              When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                              listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                              select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                              networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                              as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                              and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                              must match both specified values.



                              When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the
                              Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,
                              the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.



                              Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                              Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                              document how/if Port is interpreted.


                              For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                              long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                              listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                              namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                              from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                              the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                              following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:


                              * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                              are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                              both specified values.
                              * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                              are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                              both specified values.


                              Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                              If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                              interpreted.


                              When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                              For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                              least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                              listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                              namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from
                              the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
                              Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

            GRPCRoute provides a way to route gRPC requests. This includes the capability
            to match requests by hostname, gRPC service, gRPC method, or HTTP/2 header.
            Filters can be used to specify additional processing steps. Backends specify
            where matching requests will be routed.


            GRPCRoute falls under extended support within the Gateway API. Within the
            following specification, the word "MUST" indicates that an implementation
            supporting GRPCRoute must conform to the indicated requirement, but an
            implementation not supporting this route type need not follow the requirement
            unless explicitly indicated.


            Implementations supporting `GRPCRoute` with the `HTTPS` `ProtocolType` MUST
            accept HTTP/2 connections without an initial upgrade from HTTP/1.1, i.e. via
            ALPN. If the implementation does not support this, then it MUST set the
            "Accepted" condition to "False" for the affected listener with a reason of
            "UnsupportedProtocol".  Implementations MAY also accept HTTP/2 connections
            with an upgrade from HTTP/1.


            Implementations supporting `GRPCRoute` with the `HTTP` `ProtocolType` MUST
            support HTTP/2 over cleartext TCP (h2c,
            https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-3.1) without an initial
            upgrade from HTTP/1.1, i.e. with prior knowledge
            (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-3.4). If the implementation
            does not support this, then it MUST set the "Accepted" condition to "False"
            for the affected listener with a reason of "UnsupportedProtocol".
            Implementations MAY also accept HTTP/2 connections with an upgrade from
            HTTP/1, i.e. without prior knowledge.

                  description: |-
                    Hostnames defines a set of hostnames to match against the GRPC
                    Host header to select a GRPCRoute to process the request. This matches
                    the RFC 1123 definition of a hostname with 2 notable exceptions:


                    1. IPs are not allowed.
                    2. A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard
                       label MUST appear by itself as the first label.


                    If a hostname is specified by both the Listener and GRPCRoute, there
                    MUST be at least one intersecting hostname for the GRPCRoute to be
                    attached to the Listener. For example:


                    * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches GRPCRoutes
                      that have either not specified any hostnames, or have specified at
                      least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.
                    * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches GRPCRoutes
                      that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at least
                      one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For example,
                      `test.example.com` and `*.example.com` would both match. On the other
                      hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would not match.


                    Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted
                    as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
                    both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.


                    If both the Listener and GRPCRoute have specified hostnames, any
                    GRPCRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be
                    ignored. For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the
                    GRPCRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`,
                    `test.example.net` MUST NOT be considered for a match.


                    If both the Listener and GRPCRoute have specified hostnames, and none
                    match with the criteria above, then the GRPCRoute MUST NOT be accepted by
                    the implementation. The implementation MUST raise an 'Accepted' Condition
                    with a status of `False` in the corresponding RouteParentStatus.


                    If a Route (A) of type HTTPRoute or GRPCRoute is attached to a
                    Listener and that listener already has another Route (B) of the other
                    type attached and the intersection of the hostnames of A and B is
                    non-empty, then the implementation MUST accept exactly one of these two
                    routes, determined by the following criteria, in order:


                    * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.
                    * The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by
                      "{namespace}/{name}".


                    The rejected Route MUST raise an 'Accepted' condition with a status of
                    'False' in the corresponding RouteParentStatus.

                    ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants
                    to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent resource needs to
                    allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
                    the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
                    namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
                    namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
                    and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
                    not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
                    create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
                    Route.


                    There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:


                    * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                    * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)


                    This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                    resources.


                    ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:


                    * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
                      entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
                      multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
                      be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
                    * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
                      each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
                      optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
                      combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.


                    Some examples:


                    * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
                      same object must also set `sectionName`.
                    * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
                      object must also set `port`.
                    * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
                      referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.


                    It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
                    be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
                    choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
                    case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
                    merged.


                    Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
                    rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                    allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
                    Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                    generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.



                    ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                    routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                    any namespace to the Service.


                    ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                    "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                    connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                    the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                    ParentRef of the Route.

                      ParentReference identifies an API object (usually a Gateway) that can be considered
                      a parent of this resource (usually a route). There are two kinds of parent resources
                      with "Core" support:


                      * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                      * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)


                      This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                      resources.


                      The API object must be valid in the cluster; the Group and Kind must
                      be registered in the cluster for this reference to be valid.

                          differently based on the type of parent resource.


                          When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                          listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                          select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                          networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                          as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                          and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                          must match both specified values.



                          When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the
                          Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,
                          the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.



                          Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                          Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                          document how/if Port is interpreted.


                          For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                          long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                          listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                          namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                          from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                          attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                          the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                          * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                          are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match

                          both specified values.


                          Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                          If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                          interpreted.


                          When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                          For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                          least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                          listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,

                          sent.


                          Failure behavior here depends on how many BackendRefs are specified and
                          how many are invalid.


                          If *all* entries in BackendRefs are invalid, and there are also no filters
                          specified in this route rule, *all* traffic which matches this rule MUST
                          receive an `UNAVAILABLE` status.


                          See the GRPCBackendRef definition for the rules about what makes a single
                          GRPCBackendRef invalid.


                          When a GRPCBackendRef is invalid, `UNAVAILABLE` statuses MUST be returned for
                          requests that would have otherwise been routed to an invalid backend. If
                          multiple backends are specified, and some are invalid, the proportion of
                          requests that would otherwise have been routed to an invalid backend
                          MUST receive an `UNAVAILABLE` status.


                          For example, if two backends are specified with equal weights, and one is
                          invalid, 50 percent of traffic MUST receive an `UNAVAILABLE` status.
                          Implementations may choose how that 50 percent is determined.

                            backend protocol through its own means. Implementations MAY infer the
                            protocol from the Route type referring to the backend Service.


                            If a Route is not able to send traffic to the backend using the specified
                            protocol then the backend is considered invalid. Implementations MUST set the
                            "ResolvedRefs" condition to "False" with the "UnsupportedProtocol" reason.

                                      This filter can be used multiple times within the same rule. Note that
                                      not all implementations will be able to support mirroring to multiple

                                      Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                                      types are classified into three conformance levels:


                                      - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                        "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                        implementations supporting GRPCRoute MUST support core filters.


                                      - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                        "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                        are encouraged to support extended filters.


                                      - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by specific vendors.
                                        In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                        implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                        conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                        is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` MUST be set to
                                        "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.


                                      Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                      extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.


                                      If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                      MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                      that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

                          Filters define the filters that are applied to requests that match
                          this rule.


                          The effects of ordering of multiple behaviors are currently unspecified.
                          This can change in the future based on feedback during the alpha stage.


                          Conformance-levels at this level are defined based on the type of filter:


                          - ALL core filters MUST be supported by all implementations that support
                            GRPCRoute.
                          - Implementers are encouraged to support extended filters.
                          - Implementation-specific custom filters have no API guarantees across
                            implementations.


                          Specifying the same filter multiple times is not supported unless explicitly
                          indicated in the filter.


                          If an implementation can not support a combination of filters, it must clearly
                          document that limitation. In cases where incompatible or unsupported
                          filters are specified and cause the `Accepted` condition to be set to status
                          `False`, implementations may use the `IncompatibleFilters` reason to specify
                          this configuration error.

                                Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                                types are classified into three conformance levels:


                                - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                  "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                  implementations supporting GRPCRoute MUST support core filters.


                                - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                  "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                  are encouraged to support extended filters.


                                - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by specific vendors.
                                  In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                  implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                  conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                  is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` MUST be set to
                                  "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.


                                Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.


                                If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.

                          Matches define conditions used for matching the rule against incoming
                          gRPC requests. Each match is independent, i.e. this rule will be matched
                          if **any** one of the matches is satisfied.


                          For example, take the following matches configuration:


                          ```
                          matches:
                          - method:
                              service: foo.bar
                            headers:
                              values:
                                version: 2
                          - method:
                              service: foo.bar.v2
                          ```


                          For a request to match against this rule, it MUST satisfy
                          EITHER of the two conditions:


                          - service of foo.bar AND contains the header `version: 2`
                          - service of foo.bar.v2


                          See the documentation for GRPCRouteMatch on how to specify multiple
                          match conditions to be ANDed together.


                          If no matches are specified, the implementation MUST match every gRPC request.


                          Proxy or Load Balancer routing configuration generated from GRPCRoutes
                          MUST prioritize rules based on the following criteria, continuing on
                          ties. Merging MUST not be done between GRPCRoutes and HTTPRoutes.
                          Precedence MUST be given to the rule with the largest number of:


                          * Characters in a matching non-wildcard hostname.
                          * Characters in a matching hostname.
                          * Characters in a matching service.
                          * Characters in a matching method.
                          * Header matches.


                          If ties still exist across multiple Routes, matching precedence MUST be
                          determined in order of the following criteria, continuing on ties:


                          * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.
                          * The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by
                            "{namespace}/{name}".


                          If ties still exist within the Route that has been given precedence,
                          matching precedence MUST be granted to the first matching rule meeting
                          the above criteria.

                            GRPCRouteMatch defines the predicate used to match requests to a given
                            action. Multiple match types are ANDed together, i.e. the match will
                            evaluate to true only if all conditions are satisfied.


                            For example, the match below will match a gRPC request only if its service
                            is `foo` AND it contains the `version: v1` header:

                    Parents is a list of parent resources (usually Gateways) that are
                    associated with the route, and the status of the route with respect to
                    each parent. When this route attaches to a parent, the controller that
                    manages the parent must add an entry to this list when the controller
                    first sees the route and should update the entry as appropriate when the
                    route or gateway is modified.


                    Note that parent references that cannot be resolved by an implementation
                    of this API will not be added to this list. Implementations of this API
                    can only populate Route status for the Gateways/parent resources they are
                    responsible for.


                    A maximum of 32 Gateways will be represented in this list. An empty list
                    means the route has not been attached to any Gateway.

                          Note that the route's availability is also subject to the Gateway's own
                          status conditions and listener status.


                          If the Route's ParentRef specifies an existing Gateway that supports
                          Routes of this kind AND that Gateway's controller has sufficient access,
                          then that Gateway's controller MUST set the "Accepted" condition on the
                          Route, to indicate whether the route has been accepted or rejected by the
                          Gateway, and why.


                          A Route MUST be considered "Accepted" if at least one of the Route's
                          rules is implemented by the Gateway.


                          There are a number of cases where the "Accepted" condition may not be set
                          due to lack of controller visibility, that includes when:


                          * The Route refers to a non-existent parent.
                          * The Route is of a type that the controller does not support.
                          * The Route is in a namespace the controller does not have access to.

                              to the local namespace of the Route.


                              Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                              boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                              allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                              Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                              generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.



                              ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                              routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                              any namespace to the Service.


                              ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                              "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                              connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                              the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                              ParentRef of the Route.

                              Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                              differently based on the type of parent resource.


                              When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                              listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                              select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                              networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                              as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                              and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                              must match both specified values.



                              When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the
                              Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,
                              the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.



                              Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                              Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                              document how/if Port is interpreted.


                              For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                              long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                              listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                              namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                              from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                              the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                              following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:


                              * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                              are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                              both specified values.

                              both specified values.


                              Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                              If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                              interpreted.


                              When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                              For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                              least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                              listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                              namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from
                              the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
                              Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                  description: |-
                    Hostnames defines a set of hostnames that should match against the HTTP Host
                    header to select a HTTPRoute used to process the request. Implementations
                    MUST ignore any port value specified in the HTTP Host header while
                    performing a match and (absent of any applicable header modification
                    configuration) MUST forward this header unmodified to the backend.


                    Valid values for Hostnames are determined by RFC 1123 definition of a
                    hostname with 2 notable exceptions:


                    1. IPs are not allowed.
                    2. A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard
                       label must appear by itself as the first label.


                    If a hostname is specified by both the Listener and HTTPRoute, there
                    must be at least one intersecting hostname for the HTTPRoute to be
                    attached to the Listener. For example:


                    * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes
                      that have either not specified any hostnames, or have specified at
                      least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.
                    * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes
                      that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at least
                      one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For example,
                      `*.example.com`, `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com` would
                      all match. On the other hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would
                      not match.


                    Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted
                    as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
                    both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.


                    If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, any
                    HTTPRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be
                    ignored. For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the
                    HTTPRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`,
                    `test.example.net` must not be considered for a match.


                    If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, and none
                    match with the criteria above, then the HTTPRoute is not accepted. The
                    implementation must raise an 'Accepted' Condition with a status of
                    `False` in the corresponding RouteParentStatus.


                    In the event that multiple HTTPRoutes specify intersecting hostnames (e.g.
                    overlapping wildcard matching and exact matching hostnames), precedence must
                    be given to rules from the HTTPRoute with the largest number of:


                    * Characters in a matching non-wildcard hostname.
                    * Characters in a matching hostname.


                    If ties exist across multiple Routes, the matching precedence rules for
                    HTTPRouteMatches takes over.

                    ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants
                    to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent resource needs to
                    allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
                    the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
                    namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
                    namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
                    and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
                    not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
                    create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
                    Route.


                    There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:


                    * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                    * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)


                    This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                    resources.


                    ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:


                    * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
                      entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
                      multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
                      be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
                    * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
                      each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
                      optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
                      combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.


                    Some examples:


                    * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
                      same object must also set `sectionName`.
                    * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
                      object must also set `port`.
                    * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
                      referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.


                    It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
                    be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
                    choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
                    case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
                    merged.


                    Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
                    rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                    allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
                    Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                    generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.



                    ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                    routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                    any namespace to the Service.


                    ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                    "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                    connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                    the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                    ParentRef of the Route.

                          ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                          routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                          any namespace to the Service.


                          ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                          "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                          connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                          the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                          ParentRef of the Route.

                          Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                          differently based on the type of parent resource.


                          When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                          listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                          select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                          networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                          as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                          and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                          must match both specified values.



                          When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the
                          Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,
                          the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.



                          Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                          Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                          document how/if Port is interpreted.


                          For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                          long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                          listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                          namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                          from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                          attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                          the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                          following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:


                          * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                          are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                          both specified values.
                          * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                          are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                          both specified values.


                          Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                          If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                          interpreted.


                          When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                          For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                          least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                          listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,

                      HTTPRouteRule defines semantics for matching an HTTP request based on
                      conditions (matches), processing it (filters), and forwarding the request to
                      an API object (backendRefs).

                      backendRefs:
                        description: |-
                          BackendRefs defines the backend(s) where matching requests should be
                          sent.


                          Failure behavior here depends on how many BackendRefs are specified and
                          how many are invalid.


                          If *all* entries in BackendRefs are invalid, and there are also no filters
                          specified in this route rule, *all* traffic which matches this rule MUST
                          receive a 500 status code.


                          See the HTTPBackendRef definition for the rules about what makes a single
                          HTTPBackendRef invalid.


                          When a HTTPBackendRef is invalid, 500 status codes MUST be returned for
                          requests that would have otherwise been routed to an invalid backend. If
                          multiple backends are specified, and some are invalid, the proportion of
                          requests that would otherwise have been routed to an invalid backend
                          MUST receive a 500 status code.


                          For example, if two backends are specified with equal weights, and one is
                          invalid, 50 percent of traffic must receive a 500. Implementations may
                          choose how that 50 percent is determined.

                            When the BackendRef points to a Kubernetes Service, implementations SHOULD
                            honor the appProtocol field if it is set for the target Service Port.


                            Implementations supporting appProtocol SHOULD recognize the Kubernetes
                            Standard Application Protocols defined in KEP-3726.


                            If a Service appProtocol isn't specified, an implementation MAY infer the
                            backend protocol through its own means. Implementations MAY infer the
                            protocol from the Route type referring to the backend Service.


                            If a Route is not able to send traffic to the backend using the specified
                            protocol then the backend is considered invalid. Implementations MUST set the
                            "ResolvedRefs" condition to "False" with the "UnsupportedProtocol" reason.

                                              match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                              to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                              of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".


                                              Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                              matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                              in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                              ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                              match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.


                                              ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                              Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                              the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                          header in the response.


                                          If no port is specified, the redirect port MUST be derived using the
                                          following rules:


                                          * If redirect scheme is not-empty, the redirect port MUST be the well-known
                                            port associated with the redirect scheme. Specifically "http" to port 80
                                            and "https" to port 443. If the redirect scheme does not have a
                                            well-known port, the listener port of the Gateway SHOULD be used.
                                          * If redirect scheme is empty, the redirect port MUST be the Gateway
                                            Listener port.


                                          Implementations SHOULD NOT add the port number in the 'Location'
                                          header in the following cases:


                                          * A Location header that will use HTTP (whether that is determined via
                                            the Listener protocol or the Scheme field) _and_ use port 80.
                                          * A Location header that will use HTTPS (whether that is determined via
                                            the Listener protocol or the Scheme field) _and_ use port 443.

                                      Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                                      types are classified into three conformance levels:


                                      - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                        "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                        implementations must support core filters.


                                      - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                        "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                        are encouraged to support extended filters.


                                      - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
                                        specific vendors.
                                        In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                        implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                        conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                        is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                        "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.


                                      Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                      extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.


                                      If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                      MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                      that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.


                                      Note that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                                      must ensure that unknown values will not cause a crash.


                                      Unknown values here must result in the implementation setting the
                                      Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`, with a
                                      Reason of `UnsupportedValue`.
                                    enum:
                                      - RequestHeaderModifier

                                            description: |-
                                              ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                              match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                              to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                              of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".


                                              Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                              matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                              in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                              ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                              match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.


                                              ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                              Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                              the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                the exact proportion defined here depending on the precision an
                                implementation supports. Weight is not a percentage and the sum of
                                weights does not need to equal 100.


                                If only one backend is specified and it has a weight greater than 0, 100%
                                of the traffic is forwarded to that backend. If weight is set to 0, no
                                traffic should be forwarded for this entry. If unspecified, weight
                                defaults to 1.

                        description: |-
                          Filters define the filters that are applied to requests that match
                          this rule.


                          Wherever possible, implementations SHOULD implement filters in the order
                          they are specified.


                          Implementations MAY choose to implement this ordering strictly, rejecting
                          any combination or order of filters that can not be supported. If implementations
                          choose a strict interpretation of filter ordering, they MUST clearly document
                          that behavior.


                          To reject an invalid combination or order of filters, implementations SHOULD
                          consider the Route Rules with this configuration invalid. If all Route Rules
                          in a Route are invalid, the entire Route would be considered invalid. If only
                          a portion of Route Rules are invalid, implementations MUST set the
                          "PartiallyInvalid" condition for the Route.


                          Conformance-levels at this level are defined based on the type of filter:


                          - ALL core filters MUST be supported by all implementations.
                          - Implementers are encouraged to support extended filters.
                          - Implementation-specific custom filters have no API guarantees across
                            implementations.


                          Specifying the same filter multiple times is not supported unless explicitly
                          indicated in the filter.


                          All filters are expected to be compatible with each other except for the
                          URLRewrite and RequestRedirect filters, which may not be combined. If an
                          implementation can not support other combinations of filters, they must clearly
                          document that limitation. In cases where incompatible or unsupported
                          filters are specified and cause the `Accepted` condition to be set to status
                          `False`, implementations may use the `IncompatibleFilters` reason to specify
                          this configuration error.

                                This filter can be used multiple times within the same rule. Note that
                                not all implementations will be able to support mirroring to multiple
                                backends.

                                    If the referent cannot be found, this BackendRef is invalid and must be

                                        of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".


                                        Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                        matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                        in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                        ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                        match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.


                                        ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                        Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                        the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                      port associated with the redirect scheme. Specifically "http" to port 80
                                      and "https" to port 443. If the redirect scheme does not have a
                                      well-known port, the listener port of the Gateway SHOULD be used.

                                      Listener port.


                                    Implementations SHOULD NOT add the port number in the 'Location'
                                    header in the following cases:


                                    * A Location header that will use HTTP (whether that is determined via
                                      the Listener protocol or the Scheme field) _and_ use port 80.
                                    * A Location header that will use HTTPS (whether that is determined via
                                      the Listener protocol or the Scheme field) _and_ use port 443.

                                Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                                types are classified into three conformance levels:


                                - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                  "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                  implementations must support core filters.


                                - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                  "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                  are encouraged to support extended filters.


                                - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
                                  specific vendors.
                                  In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                  implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                  conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                  is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                  "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.


                                Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.


                                If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.


                                Note that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                                must ensure that unknown values will not cause a crash.


                                Unknown values here must result in the implementation setting the
                                Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`, with a
                                Reason of `UnsupportedValue`.
                              enum:

                                    replacePrefixMatch:
                                      description: |-
                                        ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                        match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                        to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                        of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".


                                        Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                        matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                        in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                        ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                        match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.


                                        ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                        Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                        the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                          Matches define conditions used for matching the rule against incoming
                          HTTP requests. Each match is independent, i.e. this rule will be matched
                          if **any** one of the matches is satisfied.


                          For example, take the following matches configuration:


                          ```
                          matches:
                          - path:
                              value: "/foo"
                            headers:
                            - name: "version"
                              value: "v2"
                          - path:
                              value: "/v2/foo"
                          ```


                          For a request to match against this rule, a request must satisfy
                          EITHER of the two conditions:


                          - path prefixed with `/foo` AND contains the header `version: v2`
                          - path prefix of `/v2/foo`


                          See the documentation for HTTPRouteMatch on how to specify multiple
                          match conditions that should be ANDed together.


                          If no matches are specified, the default is a prefix
                          path match on "/", which has the effect of matching every
                          HTTP request.


                          Proxy or Load Balancer routing configuration generated from HTTPRoutes
                          MUST prioritize matches based on the following criteria, continuing on
                          ties. Across all rules specified on applicable Routes, precedence must be
                          given to the match having:


                          * "Exact" path match.
                          * "Prefix" path match with largest number of characters.
                          * Method match.
                          * Largest number of header matches.
                          * Largest number of query param matches.


                          Note: The precedence of RegularExpression path matches are implementation-specific.


                          If ties still exist across multiple Routes, matching precedence MUST be
                          determined in order of the following criteria, continuing on ties:


                          * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.
                          * The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by
                            "{namespace}/{name}".


                          If ties still exist within an HTTPRoute, matching precedence MUST be granted
                          to the FIRST matching rule (in list order) with a match meeting the above
                          criteria.


                          When no rules matching a request have been successfully attached to the
                          parent a request is coming from, a HTTP 404 status code MUST be returned.

                                      entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                      entries with an equivalent header name MUST be ignored. Due to the
                                      case-insensitivity of header names, "foo" and "Foo" are considered

                                      Name is the name of the HTTP query param to be matched. This must be an
                                      exact string match. (See
                                      https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-2.7.3).


                                      If multiple entries specify equivalent query param names, only the first
                                      entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                      entries with an equivalent query param name MUST be ignored.


                                      If a query param is repeated in an HTTP request, the behavior is
                                      purposely left undefined, since different data planes have different
                                      capabilities. However, it is *recommended* that implementations should
                                      match against the first value of the param if the data plane supports it,
                                      as this behavior is expected in other load balancing contexts outside of
                                      the Gateway API.


                                      Users SHOULD NOT route traffic based on repeated query params to guard
                                      themselves against potential differences in the implementations.

                          backendRequest:
                            description: |-
                              BackendRequest specifies a timeout for an individual request from the gateway
                              to a backend. This covers the time from when the request first starts being
                              sent from the gateway to when the full response has been received from the backend.


                              Setting a timeout to the zero duration (e.g. "0s") SHOULD disable the timeout
                              completely. Implementations that cannot completely disable the timeout MUST
                              instead interpret the zero duration as the longest possible value to which
                              the timeout can be set.


                              An entire client HTTP transaction with a gateway, covered by the Request timeout,
                              may result in more than one call from the gateway to the destination backend,
                              for example, if automatic retries are supported.


                              Because the Request timeout encompasses the BackendRequest timeout, the value of
                              BackendRequest must be <= the value of Request timeout.

                              Request specifies the maximum duration for a gateway to respond to an HTTP request.
                              If the gateway has not been able to respond before this deadline is met, the gateway
                              MUST return a timeout error.


                              For example, setting the `rules.timeouts.request` field to the value `10s` in an
                              `HTTPRoute` will cause a timeout if a client request is taking longer than 10 seconds
                              to complete.


                              Setting a timeout to the zero duration (e.g. "0s") SHOULD disable the timeout
                              completely. Implementations that cannot completely disable the timeout MUST
                              instead interpret the zero duration as the longest possible value to which
                              the timeout can be set.


                              This timeout is intended to cover as close to the whole request-response transaction
                              as possible although an implementation MAY choose to start the timeout after the entire
                              request stream has been received instead of immediately after the transaction is
                              initiated by the client.


                              When this field is unspecified, request timeout behavior is implementation-specific.

                    each parent. When this route attaches to a parent, the controller that
                    manages the parent must add an entry to this list when the controller
                    first sees the route and should update the entry as appropriate when the
                    route or gateway is modified.


                    Note that parent references that cannot be resolved by an implementation
                    of this API will not be added to this list. Implementations of this API
                    can only populate Route status for the Gateways/parent resources they are

                          status conditions and listener status.


                          If the Route's ParentRef specifies an existing Gateway that supports
                          Routes of this kind AND that Gateway's controller has sufficient access,
                          then that Gateway's controller MUST set the "Accepted" condition on the
                          Route, to indicate whether the route has been accepted or rejected by the
                          Gateway, and why.


                          A Route MUST be considered "Accepted" if at least one of the Route's
                          rules is implemented by the Gateway.


                          There are a number of cases where the "Accepted" condition may not be set
                          due to lack of controller visibility, that includes when:

                              to the local namespace of the Route.


                              Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                              boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                              allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                              Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                              generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.



                              ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                              routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                              any namespace to the Service.


                              ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                              "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                              connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                              the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                              ParentRef of the Route.

                              differently based on the type of parent resource.


                              When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                              listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                              select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                              networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                              as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                              and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                              must match both specified values.



                              When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the
                              Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,
                              the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.



                              Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                              Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                              document how/if Port is interpreted.


                              For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                              long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                              listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                              namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                              from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                              the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                              * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                              are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match

                              both specified values.


                              Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                              If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is

                              For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                              least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                              listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                              namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from

                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
                              Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

            HTTPRoute provides a way to route HTTP requests. This includes the capability
            to match requests by hostname, path, header, or query param. Filters can be
            used to specify additional processing steps. Backends specify where matching
            requests should be routed.

                  description: |-
                    Hostnames defines a set of hostnames that should match against the HTTP Host
                    header to select a HTTPRoute used to process the request. Implementations
                    MUST ignore any port value specified in the HTTP Host header while
                    performing a match and (absent of any applicable header modification
                    configuration) MUST forward this header unmodified to the backend.


                    Valid values for Hostnames are determined by RFC 1123 definition of a
                    hostname with 2 notable exceptions:


                    1. IPs are not allowed.
                    2. A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard
                       label must appear by itself as the first label.


                    If a hostname is specified by both the Listener and HTTPRoute, there
                    must be at least one intersecting hostname for the HTTPRoute to be
                    attached to the Listener. For example:


                    * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes
                      that have either not specified any hostnames, or have specified at
                      least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.
                    * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes
                      that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at least
                      one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For example,
                      `*.example.com`, `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com` would
                      all match. On the other hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would
                      not match.


                    Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted
                    as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
                    both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.


                    If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, any
                    HTTPRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be
                    ignored. For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the
                    HTTPRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`,
                    `test.example.net` must not be considered for a match.


                    If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, and none
                    match with the criteria above, then the HTTPRoute is not accepted. The
                    implementation must raise an 'Accepted' Condition with a status of
                    `False` in the corresponding RouteParentStatus.


                    In the event that multiple HTTPRoutes specify intersecting hostnames (e.g.
                    overlapping wildcard matching and exact matching hostnames), precedence must
                    be given to rules from the HTTPRoute with the largest number of:


                    * Characters in a matching non-wildcard hostname.
                    * Characters in a matching hostname.


                    If ties exist across multiple Routes, the matching precedence rules for
                    HTTPRouteMatches takes over.

                    ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants
                    to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent resource needs to
                    allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
                    the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
                    namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
                    namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
                    and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
                    not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
                    create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
                    Route.


                    There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:


                    * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                    * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)


                    This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                    resources.


                    ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:


                    * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
                      entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
                      multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
                      be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
                    * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
                      each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
                      optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
                      combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.


                    Some examples:


                    * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
                      same object must also set `sectionName`.
                    * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
                      object must also set `port`.
                    * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
                      referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.


                    It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
                    be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
                    choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
                    case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
                    merged.


                    Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
                    rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                    allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
                    Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                    generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.



                    ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                    routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                    any namespace to the Service.


                    ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                    "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                    connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                    the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                    ParentRef of the Route.

                          When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                          listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                          select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                          networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                          as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                          and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                          must match both specified values.



                          When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the
                          Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,
                          the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.

                          For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                          long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                          listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                          namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                          from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                          attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                          the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                          are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                          both specified values.
                          * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                          are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                          both specified values.


                          Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                          If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                          interpreted.


                          When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                          For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                          least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                          listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                          namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from
                          the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                          attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
                          Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                      HTTPRouteRule defines semantics for matching an HTTP request based on
                      conditions (matches), processing it (filters), and forwarding the request to
                      an API object (backendRefs).

                      backendRefs:
                        description: |-
                          BackendRefs defines the backend(s) where matching requests should be
                          sent.


                          Failure behavior here depends on how many BackendRefs are specified and
                          how many are invalid.


                          If *all* entries in BackendRefs are invalid, and there are also no filters
                          specified in this route rule, *all* traffic which matches this rule MUST
                          receive a 500 status code.


                          See the HTTPBackendRef definition for the rules about what makes a single
                          HTTPBackendRef invalid.


                          When a HTTPBackendRef is invalid, 500 status codes MUST be returned for
                          requests that would have otherwise been routed to an invalid backend. If
                          multiple backends are specified, and some are invalid, the proportion of
                          requests that would otherwise have been routed to an invalid backend
                          MUST receive a 500 status code.


                          For example, if two backends are specified with equal weights, and one is
                          invalid, 50 percent of traffic must receive a 500. Implementations may
                          choose how that 50 percent is determined.

                            When the BackendRef points to a Kubernetes Service, implementations SHOULD
                            honor the appProtocol field if it is set for the target Service Port.


                            Implementations supporting appProtocol SHOULD recognize the Kubernetes
                            Standard Application Protocols defined in KEP-3726.


                            If a Service appProtocol isn't specified, an implementation MAY infer the
                            backend protocol through its own means. Implementations MAY infer the
                            protocol from the Route type referring to the backend Service.


                            If a Route is not able to send traffic to the backend using the specified
                            protocol then the backend is considered invalid. Implementations MUST set the
                            "ResolvedRefs" condition to "False" with the "UnsupportedProtocol" reason.

                                              Note that when a namespace different than the local namespace is specified,
                                              a ReferenceGrant object is required in the referent namespace to allow that
                                              namespace's owner to accept the reference. See the ReferenceGrant
                                              documentation for details.

                                              match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                              to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                              of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".


                                              Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                              matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                              in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                              ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                              match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.


                                              ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                              Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                              the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                          header in the response.


                                          If no port is specified, the redirect port MUST be derived using the

                                          * If redirect scheme is not-empty, the redirect port MUST be the well-known
                                            port associated with the redirect scheme. Specifically "http" to port 80
                                            and "https" to port 443. If the redirect scheme does not have a
                                            well-known port, the listener port of the Gateway SHOULD be used.
                                          * If redirect scheme is empty, the redirect port MUST be the Gateway
                                            Listener port.


                                          Implementations SHOULD NOT add the port number in the 'Location'
                                          header in the following cases:


                                          * A Location header that will use HTTP (whether that is determined via

                                      Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                                      types are classified into three conformance levels:


                                      - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                        "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                        implementations must support core filters.


                                      - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                        "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                        are encouraged to support extended filters.


                                      - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
                                        specific vendors.
                                        In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                        implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                        conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                        is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                        "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.


                                      Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                      extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.


                                      If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                      MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                      that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.


                                      Note that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                                      must ensure that unknown values will not cause a crash.


                                      Unknown values here must result in the implementation setting the
                                      Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`, with a
                                      Reason of `UnsupportedValue`.
                                    enum:
                                      - RequestHeaderModifier
                                      - ResponseHeaderModifier

                                              ReplaceFullPath specifies the value with which to replace the full path
                                              of a request during a rewrite or redirect.

                                          replacePrefixMatch:
                                            description: |-
                                              ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                              match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                              to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                              of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".


                                              Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                              matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                              in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                              ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                              match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.


                                              ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                              Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                              the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                        description: |-
                          Filters define the filters that are applied to requests that match
                          this rule.


                          Wherever possible, implementations SHOULD implement filters in the order
                          they are specified.


                          Implementations MAY choose to implement this ordering strictly, rejecting
                          any combination or order of filters that can not be supported. If implementations
                          choose a strict interpretation of filter ordering, they MUST clearly document
                          that behavior.


                          To reject an invalid combination or order of filters, implementations SHOULD
                          consider the Route Rules with this configuration invalid. If all Route Rules
                          in a Route are invalid, the entire Route would be considered invalid. If only
                          a portion of Route Rules are invalid, implementations MUST set the
                          "PartiallyInvalid" condition for the Route.


                          Conformance-levels at this level are defined based on the type of filter:


                          - ALL core filters MUST be supported by all implementations.
                          - Implementers are encouraged to support extended filters.
                          - Implementation-specific custom filters have no API guarantees across
                            implementations.


                          Specifying the same filter multiple times is not supported unless explicitly
                          indicated in the filter.


                          All filters are expected to be compatible with each other except for the
                          URLRewrite and RequestRedirect filters, which may not be combined. If an
                          implementation can not support other combinations of filters, they must clearly
                          document that limitation. In cases where incompatible or unsupported
                          filters are specified and cause the `Accepted` condition to be set to status
                          `False`, implementations may use the `IncompatibleFilters` reason to specify
                          this configuration error.

                                    that is not allowed by a ReferenceGrant, the controller must ensure the
                                    "ResolvedRefs"  condition on the Route is set to `status: False`,
                                    with the "RefNotPermitted" reason and not configure this backend in the
                                    underlying implementation.


                                    In either error case, the Message of the `ResolvedRefs` Condition
                                    should be used to provide more detail about the problem.

                                        ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                        match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                        to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                        of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".


                                        Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                        matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                        in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                        ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                        match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.


                                        ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                        Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                        the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                                      port associated with the redirect scheme. Specifically "http" to port 80
                                      and "https" to port 443. If the redirect scheme does not have a
                                      well-known port, the listener port of the Gateway SHOULD be used.
                                    * If redirect scheme is empty, the redirect port MUST be the Gateway
                                      Listener port.


                                    Implementations SHOULD NOT add the port number in the 'Location'
                                    header in the following cases:


                                    * A Location header that will use HTTP (whether that is determined via
                                      the Listener protocol or the Scheme field) _and_ use port 80.
                                    * A Location header that will use HTTPS (whether that is determined via
                                      the Listener protocol or the Scheme field) _and_ use port 443.

                                Type identifies the type of filter to apply. As with other API fields,
                                types are classified into three conformance levels:


                                - Core: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                  "Support: Core" in this package, e.g. "RequestHeaderModifier". All
                                  implementations must support core filters.


                                - Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by
                                  "Support: Extended" in this package, e.g. "RequestMirror". Implementers
                                  are encouraged to support extended filters.


                                - Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by
                                  specific vendors.
                                  In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple
                                  implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core
                                  conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters
                                  is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to
                                  "ExtensionRef" for custom filters.


                                Implementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to
                                extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.


                                If a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                                MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by
                                that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.


                                Note that values may be added to this enum, implementations
                                must ensure that unknown values will not cause a crash.


                                Unknown values here must result in the implementation setting the
                                Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`, with a
                                Reason of `UnsupportedValue`.
                              enum:
                                - RequestHeaderModifier

                                        ReplaceFullPath specifies the value with which to replace the full path
                                        of a request during a rewrite or redirect.

                                    replacePrefixMatch:
                                      description: |-
                                        ReplacePrefixMatch specifies the value with which to replace the prefix
                                        match of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For example, a request
                                        to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of "/foo" and a ReplacePrefixMatch
                                        of "/xyz" would be modified to "/xyz/bar".


                                        Note that this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix match type. This
                                        matches full path elements. A path element refers to the list of labels
                                        in the path split by the `/` separator. When specified, a trailing `/` is
                                        ignored. For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def` would all
                                        match the prefix `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.


                                        ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                        Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same HTTPRouteRule will result in
                                        the implementation setting the Accepted Condition for the Route to `status: False`.

                          Matches define conditions used for matching the rule against incoming
                          HTTP requests. Each match is independent, i.e. this rule will be matched
                          if **any** one of the matches is satisfied.


                          For example, take the following matches configuration:


                          ```
                          matches:
                          - path:
                              value: "/foo"
                            headers:
                            - name: "version"
                              value: "v2"
                          - path:
                              value: "/v2/foo"
                          ```


                          For a request to match against this rule, a request must satisfy
                          EITHER of the two conditions:


                          - path prefixed with `/foo` AND contains the header `version: v2`
                          - path prefix of `/v2/foo`


                          See the documentation for HTTPRouteMatch on how to specify multiple
                          match conditions that should be ANDed together.


                          If no matches are specified, the default is a prefix
                          path match on "/", which has the effect of matching every
                          HTTP request.


                          Proxy or Load Balancer routing configuration generated from HTTPRoutes
                          MUST prioritize matches based on the following criteria, continuing on
                          ties. Across all rules specified on applicable Routes, precedence must be
                          given to the match having:


                          * "Exact" path match.
                          * "Prefix" path match with largest number of characters.
                          * Method match.
                          * Largest number of header matches.
                          * Largest number of query param matches.


                          Note: The precedence of RegularExpression path matches are implementation-specific.


                          If ties still exist across multiple Routes, matching precedence MUST be
                          determined in order of the following criteria, continuing on ties:


                          * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp.
                          * The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by
                            "{namespace}/{name}".


                          If ties still exist within an HTTPRoute, matching precedence MUST be granted
                          to the FIRST matching rule (in list order) with a match meeting the above
                          criteria.


                          When no rules matching a request have been successfully attached to the
                          parent a request is coming from, a HTTP 404 status code MUST be returned.

                                      If multiple entries specify equivalent header names, only the first
                                      entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                      entries with an equivalent header name MUST be ignored. Due to the
                                      case-insensitivity of header names, "foo" and "Foo" are considered

                                  query parameters.

                                      Name is the name of the HTTP query param to be matched. This must be an
                                      exact string match. (See
                                      https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-2.7.3).


                                      If multiple entries specify equivalent query param names, only the first
                                      entry with an equivalent name MUST be considered for a match. Subsequent
                                      entries with an equivalent query param name MUST be ignored.


                                      If a query param is repeated in an HTTP request, the behavior is
                                      purposely left undefined, since different data planes have different
                                      capabilities. However, it is *recommended* that implementations should
                                      match against the first value of the param if the data plane supports it,
                                      as this behavior is expected in other load balancing contexts outside of
                                      the Gateway API.


                                      Users SHOULD NOT route traffic based on repeated query params to guard
                                      themselves against potential differences in the implementations.

                          backendRequest:
                            description: |-
                              BackendRequest specifies a timeout for an individual request from the gateway
                              to a backend. This covers the time from when the request first starts being
                              sent from the gateway to when the full response has been received from the backend.


                              Setting a timeout to the zero duration (e.g. "0s") SHOULD disable the timeout
                              completely. Implementations that cannot completely disable the timeout MUST
                              instead interpret the zero duration as the longest possible value to which
                              the timeout can be set.


                              An entire client HTTP transaction with a gateway, covered by the Request timeout,
                              may result in more than one call from the gateway to the destination backend,
                              for example, if automatic retries are supported.


                              Because the Request timeout encompasses the BackendRequest timeout, the value of
                              BackendRequest must be <= the value of Request timeout.

                            description: |-
                              Request specifies the maximum duration for a gateway to respond to an HTTP request.
                              If the gateway has not been able to respond before this deadline is met, the gateway
                              MUST return a timeout error.


                              For example, setting the `rules.timeouts.request` field to the value `10s` in an
                              `HTTPRoute` will cause a timeout if a client request is taking longer than 10 seconds
                              to complete.


                              Setting a timeout to the zero duration (e.g. "0s") SHOULD disable the timeout
                              completely. Implementations that cannot completely disable the timeout MUST
                              instead interpret the zero duration as the longest possible value to which
                              the timeout can be set.


                              This timeout is intended to cover as close to the whole request-response transaction
                              as possible although an implementation MAY choose to start the timeout after the entire
                              request stream has been received instead of immediately after the transaction is
                              initiated by the client.


                              When this field is unspecified, request timeout behavior is implementation-specific.

                    Parents is a list of parent resources (usually Gateways) that are
                    associated with the route, and the status of the route with respect to
                    each parent. When this route attaches to a parent, the controller that
                    manages the parent must add an entry to this list when the controller
                    first sees the route and should update the entry as appropriate when the
                    route or gateway is modified.


                    Note that parent references that cannot be resolved by an implementation
                    of this API will not be added to this list. Implementations of this API
                    can only populate Route status for the Gateways/parent resources they are
                    responsible for.


                    A maximum of 32 Gateways will be represented in this list. An empty list
                    means the route has not been attached to any Gateway.

                          Note that the route's availability is also subject to the Gateway's own
                          status conditions and listener status.


                          If the Route's ParentRef specifies an existing Gateway that supports
                          Routes of this kind AND that Gateway's controller has sufficient access,
                          then that Gateway's controller MUST set the "Accepted" condition on the
                          Route, to indicate whether the route has been accepted or rejected by the
                          Gateway, and why.


                          A Route MUST be considered "Accepted" if at least one of the Route's
                          rules is implemented by the Gateway.


                          There are a number of cases where the "Accepted" condition may not be set
                          due to lack of controller visibility, that includes when:


                          * The Route refers to a non-existent parent.
                          * The Route is of a type that the controller does not support.
                          * The Route is in a namespace the controller does not have access to.

                              Namespace is the namespace of the referent. When unspecified, this refers
                              to the local namespace of the Route.


                              Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                              boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                              allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                              Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                              generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.



                              ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                              routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                              any namespace to the Service.


                              ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                              "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                              connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                              the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                              ParentRef of the Route.

                              Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                              differently based on the type of parent resource.


                              When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                              listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                              select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                              networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                              as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                              and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                              must match both specified values.



                              When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the
                              Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,
                              the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.



                              Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                              Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                              document how/if Port is interpreted.


                              For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                              long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                              listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                              namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                              from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                              the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                              following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:


                              * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                              are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                              both specified values.
                              * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                              are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                              both specified values.


                              Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                              If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                              interpreted.


                              When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                              For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                              least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                              listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                              namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from
                              the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
                              Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

            ReferenceGrant identifies kinds of resources in other namespaces that are
            trusted to reference the specified kinds of resources in the same namespace
            as the policy.


            Each ReferenceGrant can be used to represent a unique trust relationship.
            Additional Reference Grants can be used to add to the set of trusted
            sources of inbound references for the namespace they are defined within.


            A ReferenceGrant is required for all cross-namespace references in Gateway API
            (with the exception of cross-namespace Route-Gateway attachment, which is
            governed by the AllowedRoutes configuration on the Gateway, and cross-namespace
            Service ParentRefs on a "consumer" mesh Route, which defines routing rules
            applicable only to workloads in the Route namespace). ReferenceGrants allowing
            a reference from a Route to a Service are only applicable to BackendRefs.


            ReferenceGrant is a form of runtime verification allowing users to assert
            which cross-namespace object references are permitted. Implementations that
            support ReferenceGrant MUST NOT permit cross-namespace references which have
            no grant, and MUST respond to the removal of a grant by revoking the access
            that the grant allowed.

            ReferenceGrant identifies kinds of resources in other namespaces that are
            trusted to reference the specified kinds of resources in the same namespace
            as the policy.


            Each ReferenceGrant can be used to represent a unique trust relationship.
            Additional Reference Grants can be used to add to the set of trusted
            sources of inbound references for the namespace they are defined within.


            All cross-namespace references in Gateway API (with the exception of cross-namespace
            Gateway-route attachment) require a ReferenceGrant.


            ReferenceGrant is a form of runtime verification allowing users to assert
            which cross-namespace object references are permitted. Implementations that
            support ReferenceGrant MUST NOT permit cross-namespace references which have
            no grant, and MUST respond to the removal of a grant by revoking the access
            that the grant allowed.

                                  ClientCIDRs are the IP CIDR ranges of the client.

                                  If multiple CIDR ranges are specified, one of the CIDR ranges must match
                                  the client IP for the rule to match.

                                  The client IP is inferred from the X-Forwarded-For header, a custom header,
                                  or the proxy protocol.
                                  You can use the `ClientIPDetection` or the `ProxyProtocol` field in
                                  the `ClientTrafficPolicy` to configure how the client IP is detected.

                                  For TCPRoute targets (raw TCP connections), HTTP headers such as
                                  X-Forwarded-For are not available. The client IP is obtained from the
                                  TCP connection's peer address. If intermediaries (load balancers, NAT)
                                  terminate or proxy TCP, the original client IP will only be available
                                  if the intermediary preserves the source address (for example by
                                  enabling the PROXY protocol or avoiding SNAT). Ensure your L4 proxy is
                                  configured to preserve the source IP to enable correct client-IP
                                  matching for TCPRoute targets.

                        Otherwise, if it is set to false or not set (defaulting to false),
                        the system blocks the traffic and returns a HTTP 5xx error, reflecting a fail-closed approach.

                                  It is highly recommended to configure active or passive health checks to ensure that failover can be detected

                    Ancestors is a list of ancestor resources (usually Gateways) that are
                    associated with the policy, and the status of the policy with respect to
                    each ancestor. When this policy attaches to a parent, the controller that
                    manages the parent and the ancestors MUST add an entry to this list when
                    the controller first sees the policy and SHOULD update the entry as
                    appropriate when the relevant ancestor is modified.

                    Note that choosing the relevant ancestor is left to the Policy designers;
                    an important part of Policy design is designing the right object level at
                    which to namespace this status.

                    Note also that implementations MUST ONLY populate ancestor status for
                    the Ancestor resources they are responsible for. Implementations MUST
                    use the ControllerName field to uniquely identify the entries in this list
                    that they are responsible for.

                    Note that to achieve this, the list of PolicyAncestorStatus structs
                    MUST be treated as a map with a composite key, made up of the AncestorRef
                    and ControllerName fields combined.

                    A maximum of 16 ancestors will be represented in this list. An empty list
                    means the Policy is not relevant for any ancestors.

                    If this slice is full, implementations MUST NOT add further entries.
                    Instead they MUST consider the policy unimplementable and signal that
                    on any related resources such as the ancestor that would be referenced
                    here. For example, if this list was full on BackendTLSPolicy, no
                    additional Gateways would be able to reference the Service targeted by
                    the BackendTLSPolicy.

                      PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an
                      associated Ancestor.

                      Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it
                      in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the
                      Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and
                      the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most
                      useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations
                      SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers
                      have a _very_ good reason otherwise.

                      In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which
                      resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy
                      targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.

                      Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the
                      ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same
                      Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying
                      implementations.

                      For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is
                      used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.
                      In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
                      ancestor object referred to in this status.

                      Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the
                      relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.

                      This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,
                      with a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.

                              generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                              listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                              namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                              from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                              the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                              SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource. In the
                              following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:

                              * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                              are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                              both specified values.
                              * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                              are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                              both specified values.

                              Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                              If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                              interpreted.

                              When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                              For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                              least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                              listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                              namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from
                              the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
                              Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                          <gateway:util:excludeFromCRD>

                          Notes for implementors:

                          Conditions are a listType `map`, which means that they function like a
                          map with a key of the `type` field _in the k8s apiserver_.

                          This means that implementations must obey some rules when updating this
                          section.

                          * Implementations MUST perform a read-modify-write cycle on this field
                            before modifying it. That is, when modifying this field, implementations
                            must be confident they have fetched the most recent version of this field,
                            and ensure that changes they make are on that recent version.
                          * Implementations MUST NOT remove or reorder Conditions that they are not
                            directly responsible for. For example, if an implementation sees a Condition
                            with type `special.io/SomeField`, it MUST NOT remove, change or update that
                            Condition.
                          * Implementations MUST always _merge_ changes into Conditions of the same Type,
                            rather than creating more than one Condition of the same Type.
                          * Implementations MUST always update the `observedGeneration` field of the
                            Condition to the `metadata.generation` of the Gateway at the time of update creation.
                          * If the `observedGeneration` of a Condition is _greater than_ the value the
                            implementation knows about, then it MUST NOT perform the update on that Condition,
                            but must wait for a future reconciliation and status update. (The assumption is that
                            the implementation's copy of the object is stale and an update will be re-triggered
                            if relevant.)

                  description: |+
                    ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants
                    to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent resource needs to
                    allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
                    the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
                    namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
                    namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
                    and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
                    not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
                    create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
                    Route.


                    There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:


                    * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                    * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)


                    This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                    resources.


                    ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:


                    * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
                      entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
                      multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
                      be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
                    * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
                      each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
                      optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
                      combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.


                    Some examples:


                    * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
                      same object must also set `sectionName`.
                    * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
                      object must also set `port`.
                    * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
                      referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.


                    It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
                    be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
                    choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the

                    Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
                    rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                    allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
                    Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                    generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.



                    ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                    routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                    any namespace to the Service.


                    ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                    "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                    connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                    the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                    ParentRef of the Route.

                      ParentReference identifies an API object (usually a Gateway) that can be considered
                      a parent of this resource (usually a route). There are two kinds of parent resources
                      with "Core" support:


                      * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                      * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)


                      This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                      resources.


                      The API object must be valid in the cluster; the Group and Kind must
                      be registered in the cluster for this reference to be valid.

                          differently based on the type of parent resource.


                          When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                          listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                          select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                          networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                          as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                          and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                          must match both specified values.



                          When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the
                          Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,
                          the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.



                          Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                          Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly

                          listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                          namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                          from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                          attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                          the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                          * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                          are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match

                          both specified values.


                          Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                          If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                          interpreted.

                          For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at

                          listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,

                                outside of the cluster and as such are difficult to reason about in
                                terms of conformance. They also may not be safe to forward to (see
                                CVE-2021-25740 for more information). Implementations SHOULD NOT
                                support ExternalName Services.

                                the exact proportion defined here depending on the precision an
                                implementation supports. Weight is not a percentage and the sum of
                                weights does not need to equal 100.


                                If only one backend is specified and it has a weight greater than 0, 100%
                                of the traffic is forwarded to that backend. If weight is set to 0, no

                    Parents is a list of parent resources (usually Gateways) that are
                    associated with the route, and the status of the route with respect to
                    each parent. When this route attaches to a parent, the controller that
                    manages the parent must add an entry to this list when the controller
                    first sees the route and should update the entry as appropriate when the
                    route or gateway is modified.


                    Note that parent references that cannot be resolved by an implementation
                    of this API will not be added to this list. Implementations of this API
                    can only populate Route status for the Gateways/parent resources they are
                    responsible for.


                    A maximum of 32 Gateways will be represented in this list. An empty list
                    means the route has not been attached to any Gateway.

                          Note that the route's availability is also subject to the Gateway's own
                          status conditions and listener status.


                          If the Route's ParentRef specifies an existing Gateway that supports
                          Routes of this kind AND that Gateway's controller has sufficient access,
                          then that Gateway's controller MUST set the "Accepted" condition on the
                          Route, to indicate whether the route has been accepted or rejected by the
                          Gateway, and why.


                          A Route MUST be considered "Accepted" if at least one of the Route's
                          rules is implemented by the Gateway.


                          There are a number of cases where the "Accepted" condition may not be set
                          due to lack of controller visibility, that includes when:


                          * The Route refers to a non-existent parent.
                          * The Route is of a type that the controller does not support.
                          * The Route is in a namespace the controller does not have access to.

                              Namespace is the namespace of the referent. When unspecified, this refers
                              to the local namespace of the Route.


                              Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                              boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                              allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                              Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                              generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.



                              ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                              routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                              any namespace to the Service.


                              ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                              "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                              connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                              the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                              ParentRef of the Route.

                              Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                              differently based on the type of parent resource.


                              When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                              listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                              select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                              networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                              as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                              and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                              must match both specified values.



                              When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the
                              Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,
                              the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.



                              Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                              Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                              document how/if Port is interpreted.


                              For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                              long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                              listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                              namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                              from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                              the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                              * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                              are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                              both specified values.
                              * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName

                              both specified values.


                              Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                              If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is

                              When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                              For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                              least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                              listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,

                              the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
                              Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                    Hostnames defines a set of SNI names that should match against the
                    SNI attribute of TLS ClientHello message in TLS handshake. This matches
                    the RFC 1123 definition of a hostname with 2 notable exceptions:


                    1. IPs are not allowed in SNI names per RFC 6066.
                    2. A hostname may be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard
                       label must appear by itself as the first label.


                    If a hostname is specified by both the Listener and TLSRoute, there
                    must be at least one intersecting hostname for the TLSRoute to be
                    attached to the Listener. For example:


                    * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches TLSRoutes
                      that have either not specified any hostnames, or have specified at
                      least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.
                    * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches TLSRoutes
                      that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at least
                      one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For example,
                      `test.example.com` and `*.example.com` would both match. On the other
                      hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would not match.


                    If both the Listener and TLSRoute have specified hostnames, any
                    TLSRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be
                    ignored. For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the
                    TLSRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`,
                    `test.example.net` must not be considered for a match.


                    If both the Listener and TLSRoute have specified hostnames, and none
                    match with the criteria above, then the TLSRoute is not accepted. The
                    implementation must raise an 'Accepted' Condition with a status of
                    `False` in the corresponding RouteParentStatus.

                    ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants
                    to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent resource needs to
                    allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
                    the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
                    namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
                    namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
                    and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
                    not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
                    create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
                    Route.


                    There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:


                    * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                    * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)


                    This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                    resources.


                    ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:


                    * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
                      entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
                      multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
                      be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
                    * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
                      each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
                      optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
                      combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.


                    Some examples:


                    * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
                      same object must also set `sectionName`.
                    * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
                      object must also set `port`.
                    * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
                      referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.


                    It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
                    be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
                    choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
                    case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
                    merged.


                    Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
                    rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                    allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
                    Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                    generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.



                    ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                    routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                    any namespace to the Service.


                    ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                    "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                    connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                    the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                    ParentRef of the Route.

                      ParentReference identifies an API object (usually a Gateway) that can be considered
                      a parent of this resource (usually a route). There are two kinds of parent resources
                      with "Core" support:


                      * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                      * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)


                      This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                      resources.


                      The API object must be valid in the cluster; the Group and Kind must
                      be registered in the cluster for this reference to be valid.

                          differently based on the type of parent resource.


                          When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                          listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                          select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                          networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                          as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                          and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                          must match both specified values.



                          When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the
                          Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,
                          the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.



                          Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                          Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                          document how/if Port is interpreted.


                          For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                          long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                          listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                          namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                          from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                          attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                          the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                          * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                          are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match

                          both specified values.


                          Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                          If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                          interpreted.

                          For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at

                          listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,

                            Implementations supporting appProtocol SHOULD recognize the Kubernetes
                            Standard Application Protocols defined in KEP-3726.


                            If a Service appProtocol isn't specified, an implementation MAY infer the
                            backend protocol through its own means. Implementations MAY infer the
                            protocol from the Route type referring to the backend Service.


                            If a Route is not able to send traffic to the backend using the specified
                            protocol then the backend is considered invalid. Implementations MUST set the

                                the exact proportion defined here depending on the precision an

                    Parents is a list of parent resources (usually Gateways) that are
                    associated with the route, and the status of the route with respect to
                    each parent. When this route attaches to a parent, the controller that
                    manages the parent must add an entry to this list when the controller
                    first sees the route and should update the entry as appropriate when the
                    route or gateway is modified.


                    Note that parent references that cannot be resolved by an implementation
                    of this API will not be added to this list. Implementations of this API
                    can only populate Route status for the Gateways/parent resources they are
                    responsible for.


                    A maximum of 32 Gateways will be represented in this list. An empty list
                    means the route has not been attached to any Gateway.

                          status conditions and listener status.


                          If the Route's ParentRef specifies an existing Gateway that supports
                          Routes of this kind AND that Gateway's controller has sufficient access,
                          then that Gateway's controller MUST set the "Accepted" condition on the
                          Route, to indicate whether the route has been accepted or rejected by the
                          Gateway, and why.


                          A Route MUST be considered "Accepted" if at least one of the Route's
                          rules is implemented by the Gateway.


                          There are a number of cases where the "Accepted" condition may not be set
                          due to lack of controller visibility, that includes when:


                          * The Route refers to a non-existent parent.
                          * The Route is of a type that the controller does not support.
                          * The Route is in a namespace the controller does not have access to.

                              to the local namespace of the Route.


                              Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                              boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                              allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                              Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                              generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.



                              ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                              routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                              any namespace to the Service.


                              ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                              "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                              connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which

                              Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                              differently based on the type of parent resource.


                              When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                              listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                              select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                              networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                              as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                              and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                              must match both specified values.



                              When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the
                              Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,
                              the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.



                              Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                              Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                              document how/if Port is interpreted.


                              For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                              long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                              listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                              namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                              from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                              the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                              following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:


                              * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                              are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                              both specified values.

                              both specified values.


                              Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                              If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is

                              When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                              For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                              least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                              listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                              namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from
                              the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
                              Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                    ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants
                    to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent resource needs to
                    allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
                    the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
                    namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
                    namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
                    and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
                    not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
                    create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
                    Route.


                    There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:


                    * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                    * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)


                    This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                    resources.


                    ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:


                    * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
                      entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
                      multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
                      be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
                    * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
                      each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
                      optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
                      combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.


                    Some examples:


                    * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
                      same object must also set `sectionName`.
                    * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
                      object must also set `port`.
                    * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
                      referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.


                    It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
                    be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
                    choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
                    case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
                    merged.


                    Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
                    rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                    allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
                    Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                    generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.



                    ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                    routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                    any namespace to the Service.


                    ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                    "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                    connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                    the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                    ParentRef of the Route.

                      The API object must be valid in the cluster; the Group and Kind must
                      be registered in the cluster for this reference to be valid.

                          To set the core API group (such as for a "Service" kind referent),
                          Group must be explicitly set to "" (empty string).

                          to the local namespace of the Route.


                          Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                          boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                          allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                          Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                          generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.



                          ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                          routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                          any namespace to the Service.


                          ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                          "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                          connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                          the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                          ParentRef of the Route.

                          Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                          differently based on the type of parent resource.


                          When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                          listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                          select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                          networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                          as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                          and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                          must match both specified values.



                          When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the
                          Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,
                          the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.



                          Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                          Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                          document how/if Port is interpreted.


                          For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                          long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                          listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                          namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                          from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                          attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                          the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                          following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:


                          * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                          are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                          both specified values.
                          * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                          are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                          both specified values.


                          Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                          If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                          interpreted.


                          When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                          For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                          least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                          listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                          namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from
                          the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                          attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
                          Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                            When the BackendRef points to a Kubernetes Service, implementations SHOULD
                            honor the appProtocol field if it is set for the target Service Port.


                            Implementations supporting appProtocol SHOULD recognize the Kubernetes
                            Standard Application Protocols defined in KEP-3726.


                            If a Service appProtocol isn't specified, an implementation MAY infer the
                            backend protocol through its own means. Implementations MAY infer the
                            protocol from the Route type referring to the backend Service.


                            If a Route is not able to send traffic to the backend using the specified
                            protocol then the backend is considered invalid. Implementations MUST set the
                            "ResolvedRefs" condition to "False" with the "UnsupportedProtocol" reason.

                                backend. This is computed as weight/(sum of all weights in this
                                BackendRefs list). For non-zero values, there may be some epsilon from
                                the exact proportion defined here depending on the precision an
                                implementation supports. Weight is not a percentage and the sum of
                                weights does not need to equal 100.


                                If only one backend is specified and it has a weight greater than 0, 100%
                                of the traffic is forwarded to that backend. If weight is set to 0, no
                                traffic should be forwarded for this entry. If unspecified, weight

                    Parents is a list of parent resources (usually Gateways) that are
                    associated with the route, and the status of the route with respect to
                    each parent. When this route attaches to a parent, the controller that
                    manages the parent must add an entry to this list when the controller
                    first sees the route and should update the entry as appropriate when the
                    route or gateway is modified.


                    Note that parent references that cannot be resolved by an implementation
                    of this API will not be added to this list. Implementations of this API
                    can only populate Route status for the Gateways/parent resources they are
                    responsible for.


                    A maximum of 32 Gateways will be represented in this list. An empty list
                    means the route has not been attached to any Gateway.

                          Note that the route's availability is also subject to the Gateway's own
                          status conditions and listener status.


                          If the Route's ParentRef specifies an existing Gateway that supports
                          Routes of this kind AND that Gateway's controller has sufficient access,
                          then that Gateway's controller MUST set the "Accepted" condition on the
                          Route, to indicate whether the route has been accepted or rejected by the
                          Gateway, and why.


                          A Route MUST be considered "Accepted" if at least one of the Route's
                          rules is implemented by the Gateway.


                          There are a number of cases where the "Accepted" condition may not be set
                          due to lack of controller visibility, that includes when:


                          * The Route refers to a non-existent parent.
                          * The Route is of a type that the controller does not support.
                          * The Route is in a namespace the controller does not have access to.

                            description: |-
                              Namespace is the namespace of the referent. When unspecified, this refers
                              to the local namespace of the Route.


                              Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                              boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                              allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                              Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                              generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.



                              ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                              routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                              any namespace to the Service.


                              ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                              "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                              connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                              the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                              ParentRef of the Route.

                            description: |-
                              Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                              differently based on the type of parent resource.


                              When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                              listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                              select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                              networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                              as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                              and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                              must match both specified values.



                              When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the
                              Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,
                              the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.



                              Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                              Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                              document how/if Port is interpreted.


                              For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                              long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                              listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                              namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                              from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                              the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                              SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource. In the
                              following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:


                              * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                              are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                              both specified values.
                              * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                              are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                              both specified values.


                              Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                              If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                              interpreted.


                              When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                              For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                              least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                              listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                              namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from
                              the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
                              Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.
